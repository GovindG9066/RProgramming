# 📊 R Programming - Data Mining Assignments

Welcome to my repository for **R Programming** assignments, created as part of my **Data Mining** coursework. All the programs and datasets are structured neatly for easy execution and reference.

---

## ✅ About the Project

- This repository contains **complete solutions for Data Mining practical assignments** using **R Programming** and **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**.
- All programs are categorized as per assignment topics (RStudio & Jupyter).
- Includes code for **data preprocessing, classification, regression, and more**.
- Datasets used in the programs are stored in the `database` folder.
